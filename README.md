# DiceServer
Server to Multiple client setup to facilitate dice rolling in an online (voice chat) setting.

I started this project to aid my friends and I when playing Dungeons and Dragons over voice chat.
We needed a way to easily create random dice rolls without having to completely rely on the honor system (which admittedly
wasn't the problem) or the need for everyone to even have their own dice handy.

I also wanted to practice with using sockets and asynchronous data transfer so this seemed a good place to start.
